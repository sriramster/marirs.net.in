*** Reboot

I was introduced to Computers by my cousin's at around 7th grade,  when I first ran my Graphics program (I ran, only using a ./$PROGRAM) 
and saw a colorful screen then I queried about it my cousin said he used  <graphics.h>, which was the only engine then on a LG-CRT monitor, 
with his TVS-gold Keyboard smiling. Well, I knew there was a thing for computers  within me. 

This is my reboot of blogging or noting down life things. I'd gone incognito for couple of years after my kid was born, now its almost 2 years my wife 
started to work. I thought I needed something for myself. So back to writing about tech and life here. Let's see how far technicaly I keep this. 

Back on hcoop as well, thanks for the admins for giving back my old-ids.
